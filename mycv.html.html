    <h2>Skills:</h2>
        <ul><li>B2B & B2C sales experience:</li>
            <ul><li>This experience spans across customers from all walks of life, differing backgrounds
                and circumstances. This really helped me to shape my understanding of how best to deal with
                a multitude of customers.</li>
            <li>Dealing with B2B Clients has helped me to improve my professionalism and approach in certain scenarios.
                All clients are just people, but being able to find the balance of how to discuss specific topics with people
                in the correct way at the correct time, really helps to improve the way the sales process can be managed.
            </li></ul>
            <li>Determination & Eagerness to Succeed
                <ul><li>As cheesy as this may sound, it is true. I struggle to be satisfied at work if I am not achieving my 
                 targets. I strive to over achieve wherever possible and always try to go above and beyond in every aspect of my roles.
